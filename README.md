# Loan Defaulter Prediction Using Machine Learning
# Abstract:
The bank Indessa has not been performing well for the last three quarters and would like to improve their bank’s performance by reducing their NPA’s Since the data which is collected is very messy identification of defaulters who are the major cause
which increases the NPA’s has become difficult. So we are devising a model which can predict whether the person who is a loan applicant or so already has a loan will be a potential defaulter in the future.

# Objectives:
Bank Indessa face challenges in identifying the loan applicants of those who can be potential defaulter. Any discrepancies in data faced by the employees against a set of standards can indicate that the loan the applicant can be a potential defaulter and can mark the applicants for any differences against some set standards if they have crossed the set number of marking (parameters which have been found) they can be identified as a potential defaulter and the approval of the loan can be rejected.

The objective of this Capstone Project is to predict the optimal parameters for the identification of potential defaulters of a loan to meet the stockholder confidence in their company and to carry out any future increase of NPA’s (non-performing assets) and increase the company’s share in the market.

# Result:
The constructed machine learning model helps bank to predict the loan defaulter and this model is assessed using the metric Accuracy, among them Ensemble Model with XGBoost gives the maximum prediction accuracy of more than 84%.
